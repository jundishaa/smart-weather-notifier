## Features
- **Real-time Weather Notifications:** Get alerts based on your specified weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow).
- **Customizable Preferences:** Users can choose their preferred notification method (email or SMS) and set conditions for alerts.
- **Weather History:** View a history of past weather notifications and conditions.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system to manage user preferences and notifications.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **APIs:**
  - OpenWeatherMap for real-time weather data.
  - SendGrid/Twilio for sending email and SMS notifications.
- **Other Tools:** Docker, Git, Nginx

## Architecture
The Smart Weather Notifier architecture follows a modular design:

- **Frontend (React.js):** A responsive interface for setting up alerts, viewing weather data, and managing user settings.
- **Backend (Flask):** Handles API requests, processes weather data, stores user preferences, and manages notification triggers.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores user data, preferences, and historical weather data.
- **External APIs:** 
  - OpenWeatherMap: Provides real-time weather data based on user-defined locations.
  - SendGrid/Twilio: Sends email or SMS notifications based on predefined weather conditions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- MySQL
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-weather-notifier.git
   cd smart-weather-notifier/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Database Setup
1. Create the MySQL database and tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE smart_weather_notifier;
   USE smart_weather_notifier;
   -- Run the SQL script provided in /backend/db/schema.sql to create the necessary tables
   ```

2. Update the database connection settings in the `.env` file.

### Docker Setup (Optional)
1. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage
1. **Sign Up:** Create a new account.
2. **Login:** Access your dashboard.
3. **Set Preferences:** Choose your location, weather conditions, and notification method (email or SMS).
4. **Receive Alerts:** Get real-time notifications based on your preferences.
5. **View History:** Check past weather notifications.

## API Endpoints
- **/api/weather** (GET): Retrieves current weather data for the user’s selected location.
- **/api/notifications** (POST): Subscribes the user to weather alerts.
- **/api/settings** (GET/PUT): Retrieves or updates the user’s notification preferences.
- **/api/history** (GET): Returns a list of past notifications sent to the user.

## Data Model
- **Users Table:**
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `phone_number`
  - `preferred_notification_method`
- **Weather_Preferences Table:**
  - `preference_id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `location`
  - `condition` (rain, snow, etc.)
  - `alert_time`
- **Notifications Table:**
  - `notification_id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `date_sent`
  - `weather_condition`
  - `delivery_status`

## Challenges
- **Integrating Flask with MySQL:** Setting up secure and efficient database connections required additional research and time.
- **Time Management:** Balancing the learning curve with actual development tasks was challenging but ultimately rewarding.
- **API Rate Limits:** Managing the rate limits of external APIs like OpenWeatherMap required implementing efficient caching mechanisms.

## Future Improvements
- **Expand Notification Methods:** Add support for additional notification methods, such as push notifications.
- **Enhanced Weather Analytics:** Provide users with more detailed weather trends and analytics.
- **Localization:** Support multiple languages and units of measurement to cater to a global audience.
